its just a simple bot that uploads frame on tho the Nividia gaugan AI to convert them , im italian so maybe it will have some grammatical error and im not shure if ti works whit other pc but go haead and modifyit as you like.

please create a folder named "frame"(without the quotes) in the same folder of the .py and the .PNG file. 
all the .png files in the  folder "frame" have to be named 0.png,1.png.....20.png and so on.
